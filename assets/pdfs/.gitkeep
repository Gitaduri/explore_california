Git does not track empty directories.
Git is designed to be a file-tracking system (for files and their contents).
- tracks files
- tracks the directories it takes to get to files
- ignores directories with no files

that's why a hiddle little '.gitkeep' file will force git to track the directory
even if there are no (really used) files in it, so we can track the development
of a skeleton, for example.
